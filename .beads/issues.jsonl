The ID generation and reconciliation logic should be stateless and easily testable.\n\n## Completion Criteria\n\n- Multi-ID strategy implemented\n- Fallback hash generation working\n- Reconciliation logic tested\n- Unit tests passing\n- PR created (do not merge until Phase 1 complete)\n\n## Downstream Dependencies\n\nTrack E (Sync Engine) depends on this track.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T15:13:25.464331-07:00","created_by":"I852000","updated_at":"2026-01-14T09:50:59.733775-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-14T09:50:59.733775-07:00","close_reason":"Implemented CalendarIdGenerator with multi-ID strategy, fallback hash, recurring event IDs, and reconciliation logic. 29 passing tests.","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"swiftea-s1l","depends_on_id":"swiftea-gij","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T15:15:30.578729-07:00","created_by":"I852000"}]}
