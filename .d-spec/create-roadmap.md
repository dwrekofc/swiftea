# Creating / Updating a Roadmap

Use this when the user wants a phased plan across multiple ideas or capabilities.

## Where To Save

- Prefer `docs/roadmap.md` (or a small set of `docs/roadmap-*.md` files) so discovery can load it quickly.

## Interview (AskUserTool)

All interviews and context gathering MUST be facilitated with `AskUserTool`.

Ask option-based questions about:
- Near-term outcome (next milestone)
- Phase boundaries (what defines done for Phase 1)
- Dependencies between ideas
- Risk reducers (spikes, prototypes, validation)
- Time constraints (if any)

## Output Format (Suggested)

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: 3–7 bullets, each linkable to an idea doc or OpenSpec change
- **Phase 2**: 3–7 bullets
- **Phase 3+**: high level themes

## Relationship To OpenSpec + Beads

- Roadmap items should usually point to idea docs first.
- Only after an idea is selected and clarified should it become an OpenSpec change.
- Beads issues are created only after the OpenSpec proposal is approved in chat.
